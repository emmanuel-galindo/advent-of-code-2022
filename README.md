# advent-of-code-2022

First year taking part of this, one day at a time... let's see how far the streak goes

I am using Golang ~~and TDD~~ to tackle the challenges.

This is an experiment space to refresh some general concepts while learning Golang. Each solution focus on a specific learning area I wanted to focus, and each of them will have trade-offs on clean code (ie procedures passing many args via refs vs structs to keep the state). 

I have tried to keep it idiomatic though, and would love your feedback!
